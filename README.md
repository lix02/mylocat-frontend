#MyLocat - Frontend

This is the frontend for MyLocat, a personal safety web application designed to work with a wearable device. Built with React and Vite, this interface allows users to manage emergency contacts, trigger alerts, and interact with location data â€“ all powered by a Spring Boot API.

This project connects to the [MyLocat Backend API](https://github.com/lix02/mylocat-backend).

#How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/lix02/mylocat-frontend.git
2. Install dependencies
   npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root directory with this content:
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   (Adjust the port if your backend runs on something other than 8080)
4. Start the development server
   npm run dev

This app will be available at http://localhost:5173
(If this port is taken, Vite will use the next available one automatically.)
